== Introduction

=== About AlphaNUS

NUS treasurers often come face to face with piles of payment forms filled with payments for claims and also need to
keep track of their statuses. Having to manage and allocate club funds to multiple projects, treasurers
may find it a chore to keep up to date with their finances.

*AlphaNUS* is a financial management assistant for treasurers to keep track of payment forms made by payees as well as manage the club's funds for projects.

This developer guide includes detailed documentation on the designs and implementations of the project and how developers can make changes it.

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `11`* or above
. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.

=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

== Design
.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above displays the n-tier architecture design of the AlphaNUS. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Command,*`Command`*>>: The command executor and parser.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

The UI solely consists of a `Ui` object that is initiated at the start of the program.

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Command` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Command]]
=== Command component

.Structure of the Command Component
image::CommandClassDiagram.png[]

The `Command` component consists of:

* `Parser` to make sense of user input.
* `Instruction` to determine which process to execute.
* `Process` to process the execution of the command.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component
[[fig-ModelClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

.  Both `Project Manager` and `Payment Manager` takes in user command from `Command`.
.  The `Project Manager` class manages a HashMap of `Project` objects.
.  Each `Project` object contains a `Budget` and a HashMap of `Payee` objects.
.  Each `Payee` object contains an ArrayList of `Payments` objects.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `Project` object by `PaymentManager` and passed back to `Command`.

[[Design-Storage]]

== Implementation
This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.


=== Project Feature
The `project` feature is managed by the `ProjectManager` class, which is called by the
`Process` class in the `Command` component.

This feature supports the following commands:

* `add project pr/PROJECT_NAME` -- Adds a new project to the record.
* `delete project pr/PROJECT_NAME` -- Deletes a project from the record.
* `goto project pr/PROJECT_NAME` -- Go to a project in the record.
* `list project` -- Lists all projects in the record.

A detailed explanation of the use case for the `add project` command is given below to demonstrate how each component interacts with each other.

1. User executes the command `add project pr/RAG` in the CLI. This input is passed from the `Ui` to `Command` where the input will be parsed to determine the command to execute.

2. The `Command` component will process the `add project` command and execute it in the `Model` component, calling `ProjectManager` to add a new `Project` object with the user defined `PROJECT_NAME` to its HashMap of `Project` objects.

3. `ProjectManager` then returns a value of the newly created `Project` object to `Command` which is passed to `Ui` for printing the project details to the user.

Below is a sequence diagram to provide a visual representation of the `add project` command.

[[fig-AddProjectSeqDiagram]]
.Sequence Diagram of the add project command
image::AddProjectSeqDiagram.png[]

The `delete project` command is implemented in the same manner to the `add project` command. Both return the `Project` object that was deleted or added to be passed to `Ui` for printing its details to the user. The `delete project` command only differs from the `add project` command when it deletes the `Project` object from the HashMap of `Project` objects, in contrast to adding a `Project` object to the HashMap.

// end::Project[]

//tag::payee
=== Payee Feature
==== Payee Class
The `Payee` Class object holds all information regarding the identity of the payee, as well as an ArrayList `payments` of `Payment` objects.
When a new `Payee` object is created, it is stored in the respective HashMap `managerMap` for the specific project the payee is being paid for. +
The following are the class members storing the payee's identity information.

** Name : `name`
** Email Address : `email`
** Matriculation Number : `matricNum`
** Phone Number : `phoneNum`

==== Payments Class
The `Payments` Class object stores the details of the payment being made. A `Payments` object once constructed will be added to the ArrayList `payments` member of the specified payee the payment is being made to.
The following are the class members storing the payment's details.

** Description of Payment : `item`
** Amount being paid : `cost`
** Invoice Number : `inv`
** Due date for payment : `deadline`

Note that the due date is automatically set to 30 days after the creation of the `Payments` object.

==== Field and Status Enums
The feature is also supported by 2 enum objects, `Field`; +

** PAYEE
** EMAIL
** MATRIC
** PHONE
** ITEM
** COST
** INV
** DEADLINE
** STATUS

and `Status`: +

** PENDING
** APPROVED
** OVERDUE

==== Payee Feature Commands
The payee feature supports the following commands:

* `add payee p/name e/email m/matricNum ph/phoneNum` -- Adds a new payee to the record.
* `add payment p/name i/item c/cost v/inv` -- Adds a new payee to the record.
* `delete payee p/name` -- Deletes a payee from the record.
* `delete payment p/name v/inv` -- Deletes a payment from the record.
* `edit p/name v/inv f/field r/replacement` -- Edits data for an existing payee in the record.
* `find p/name` -- Lists all payments for specified payee in the record.

==== PaymentManager
The `PaymentManager` is an abstract class that is subclassed in the payments package, which contains the `Payee` and `Payments` classes. It serves to process the input from the `Command` package and implement the payee feature commands (Section 4.2.4). The `PaymentManager` class implements the following methods:

* PaymentManager#addPayee
* PaymentManager#addPayments
* PaymentManager#deletePayee
* PaymentManager#deletePayments
* PaymentManager#editPayee
* PaymentManager#findPayee

A detailed explanation of the use case for the add payee command is given below to demonstrate how each component interacts with each other. +
1. User executes the command `add payee p/name e/email m/matricNum ph/phoneNum` in the CLI. This input is passed from the Ui to Command where the input will be parsed to determine the command to execute. +
2. The PaymentManager is invoked, and in this case, the addPayee method is called. The method checks which project is currently selected and constructs a new Payee object. The Payee object is pushed into the current project's managerMap, a HashMap of all the project's payees. +
3. Assuming a valid input was passed from the user, a confirmation message showing the summary of the details of the newly created Payee would be printed. Else, an error will prompt the user to try again and provide the correct template for the command they attempted. +

=== History Feature
The `history` feature is implemented to keep track of the list of all input commands entered by the user. It is facilitated by the `Storage` class which is called by the `Process` class in the `command` component.

This feature supports the following commands:

* `history` - lists all the input commands(with the date and time beside) entered by the user.
* (proposed) `view history h/DATE to DATE` - lists the input commands entered by the user during a certain time period.
* (proposed) `delete history h/DATE to DATE` - deletes the input commands entered by the user during a certain time period.

The use case for the `history` command is given below to show how each component interacts with each other.

1. The user executes the `history` command in the CLI. The input is passed from `Ui` to `command` to determine the command to execute.

2. The `Command` component will process the `history` command and load the txt file consisting the input commands from the `Storage` class into an arraylist.

3. This arraylist is passed to `Ui` for printing the list of input commands to the user.

Below is the sequence diagram showing the interactions between the different components used to implement the `history` command.

image::sequenceDiagramforHistory.PNG[]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How `view history h/DATE to DATE` is implemented
* Alternative 1(proposed): The application loops through the arraylist of all the input commands loaded from the txt file in storage. This is done to find the index(i1) of the first command entered on the first/earlier `DATE` and the index(i2) of the last command entered on the second/later `DATE`.
Then commands in the for loop from index i1 to i2 are added to a new arraylist. This arraylist is printed to the user.

//tag::deadline
=== Add Invoices

==== Implementation
The add invoice function is an extending feature for `payment`. It considers real life situations and automatically set up the deadline for submission of payment forms for the users.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `add invoice` behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user add in a new payment form form submission. Now there is no invoice for this submission, therefore both invoice and deadline should be shown as null.

Step 2: The user gets the corresponding invoice. He then sets the invoice number to the deadline using the command `invoice ID i/INVOICE_NUMBER`.

Step 3: The user then call the `list` command, he can observe that the deadline is automatically set to 30 days after the current date. The invoice number is not null anymore as well.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How add invoice executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The deadline is set to a fixed date(30 days after the invoice comes). The deadline can be adjusted using `reschedule` and `snooze`.
** Pros: Easy for the NUS treasurers to use.
** Cons: The customers cannot customize the time gap between the submission deadline and the date they get the deadline.
* **Alternative 2:** The user can set the gap time by themselves.
** Pros: In this way the application is more customized and can be applied to different situations.
** Cons: This might cause unnecessary inconvenience.

image::AddInvoiceSeqDiagram.png[]
//end of add invoice

//tag: reminder
=== (Proposed) Reminder
==== Proposed Implementation
The reminder function is another extending feature for payment. By calling the relative command `reminder`, AlphaNUS will return the deadline with the highest priority (i.e. the earliest deadline). The deadline with the highest priority will also be shown at the starting page so as to perform as a reminder for the user.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `reminder` behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user launches the application for the first time. No reminder will be shown on the starting page as there is no deadline.

Step 2: The user adds in new deadlines and assigns different deadlines to it by adding invoice at different dates.

Step 3: Now the user can perform 'reminder' command. AlphaNUS will return a deadline task which has the earliest deadline among all the current deadlines that have received their invoices. If there is no submissions with their deadlines set, AlphaNUS will return a null result.

Step 4: The user exit AlphaNUS through `bye` command. When he relaunch the application, the reminder of the deadline with the highest priority will be shown on the starting page.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How reminder executes
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** the application performs sorting on the tasklist and returns the first element everytime the command is called
** Pros: The result is accurate
** Cons: This will cause the application to be slow when there are many tasks to be processed.
* **Alternative 2:** The application only performs sorting once when a new task is added. The result id will be stored in a single integer.
** Pros: This method saves memory required and minimize the runtime when the command is called.
** Cons: It might be inaccurate when the user applies reschedule. Possible solution is to sort the list everytime the user reschedule a task. This will make the reschedule command to be slow on the other hand.
