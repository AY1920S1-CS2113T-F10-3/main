= Leow Yong Heng - Project Portfolio for AlphaNUS

== Overview

NUS treasurers often come face to face with piles of payment forms filled with payments for claims and also need to
keep track of their statuses. Having to manage and allocate club funds to multiple projects, treasurers
may find it a chore to keep up to date with their finances.

*AlphaNUS* is a financial management assistant for treasurers to manage their payment forms made by payees as well as manage the club's funds for projects. The application is CLI-based and aims to help treasurers save time in carrying out their duties.

== Summary of contributions

This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions
to the team project.

* *Enhancement feature added*: The ability to manage multiple projects*.
** What it does: The user(treasurer) would be able to create and delete projects that he or she is currently in charge of. The treasurer would also be able to go to assign budgets to projects and go to a particular project to add payments under the project.
** Justification: This is a core functionality in our product that allows the treasurer to be able to keep track of the various payments and budget for each project.
** Highlights: This enhancement connects to many other existing functionalities. For example, the treasurer would need to keep track of the budget that has been assigned to a project and also the corresponding payments made for each project. The implementation required careful consideration of the structure of how the projects were going to be stored and integrate well with the various functionalities.
